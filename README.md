### What is Closed Caption Maker?

Closed Caption Maker allows you generate a transcript then add subtitles for your videos. After generating the subtitles the custom editor allows to make edits to the generated transcript and even translate the subtitles to any of the [supported languages](https://github.com/gAlexander77/Closed-Caption-Maker/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/Home/supportedLanguages.tsx). Once you are satisfied with the final transcript you can then request a download of your video with the subtitles embedded into the video.
